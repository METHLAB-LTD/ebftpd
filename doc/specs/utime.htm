<p align="left"><b>The problem</b></p>
<p align="left">The original FTP specification and recent extensions to it do not include any way 
to preserve the time and data for files
<i>uploaded</i> to a FTP server.<br>
The modification time of a file is often used by users sorting directory 
listings or by scripts deciding if one file is newer than another file.<br>
A mechanism is need where files can be uploaded to a server and the time and 
date preserved.</p>
<p align="left">Two systems to preserve the time and date are currently used by 
some FTP cliets and FTP servers. These are the <b>SITE UTIME</b> and <b>MDTM</b> 
commands.<br>
Both of these have problems.<b> SITE UTIME</b> this implemented in different 
ways by different applications.<br>
<b>MDTM</b> is ambiguous if files with filenames containing dates are present.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The solution<br>
</b>The solution is to define a new command, submit it to IETF as a Internet 
Draft and ultmatly produce a RFC.<br>
This web page defines two alternative commands and acts as an initial starting 
point for the Internet Draft.<br>
The new commands <b>SRFT (S</b>et
<b>R</b>emote <b>F</b>ile <b>T</b>ime) and <b>MODA</b> (Modify Attributes) are 
defined.<br>
One of these two commands will be selected.</p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><u><b>SITE commands</b></u></p>
<p align="left">The FTP command "<b>SITE</b>" can be used to extend the FTP protocol 
and to allow site specific commands to be carried out by the FTP server.</p>
<p align="left">Several FTP implementation have created a <b>SITE UTIME</b> 
command which lets a FTP client set the time and date attributes of a file on the server.<br>
The command gets its name from the C library function called <i>utime</i> 
which sets access time and modification time of a file.<br>
The purpose of SITE commands is to allow FTP clients and servers to implement 
extra commands as they see fit and as such there is no single standard for these 
commands.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">An investigation of various open source FTP applications and 
conversations with FTP authors have revealed three flavours of the <b>SITE UTIME</b> 
command in common usage</p>
<p align="left"><b>Type 1</b></p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse" id="AutoNumber3" border="0" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" height="28" width="100%">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td height="28" width="19%">&nbsp;</td>
    <td height="28" width="81%">
    <table style="border-collapse: collapse" id="AutoNumber2" border="1" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" height="18" width="89%">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td height="18" width="100%"><b>SITE &lt;sp&gt; UTIME &lt;sp&gt; filename &lt;sp&gt; 
        datetime1 &lt;sp&gt; datetime2 &lt;sp&gt; datetime3 &lt;sp&gt; UTC</b></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filename is the name of the file to modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
datetime#1 is the file's access time, converted to UTC and in the format 
YYYYMMDDhhmmss<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
datetime#2 is the file's modification time, converted to UTC and in the format 
YYYYMMDDhhmmss<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
datetime#3 is the file's creation time, converted to UTC and in the format 
YYYYMMDDhhmmss<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the filename is sent as the first parameter and this causes problems when there 
is a <i>space</i> within the filename. FTP servers need to parse the command 
line carefully. For example in the case of SITE UTIME data log.txt 
20050101123000 20050101123000 20050101123000 UTC, an incorrect parser would 
identify the 2nd parameter (ie datetime1) as "log.txt"</p>
<p><b>Type 2</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filename is the name of the file to modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
datetime is the file's modification time and in the format YYYYMMDDhhmm. Note it 
does not include the seconds.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type 1 commands are used by the lftp client, the ncftp client (version3), the 
wzdFTPd server and the Crush FTP server<br>
Type 2 commands are used by the gftp client<br>
Type 3 commands are used by the ProFTPd client</p>
<p>In addition NFTP, OS/2's FTPServer and the Perl Net::FTPServer all implement 
a SITE UTIME command but the parameters are not known at this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Announcing the SITE UTIME command</b></p>
<p>Some FTP servers report their support for a <b>SITE UTIME</b> in response to
<b>SITE HELP</b> or <b>HELP SITE</b> commands.</p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><u><b>MDTM command overloading</b></u></p>

<p align="left">The <b>MDTM</b> command was introduced with the FTP Extensions Internet Draft. 
It is used by a client to <i>read</i> the modification time of a file on the 
server.<br>
It has since been used by several FTP clients and several FTP servers to <i>set</i> 
the modification time of a file on the server.</p>

<p align="left">To <i>read</i> the modification the following command is used:-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>MDTM &lt;sp&gt; 
filename<br>
</b>This returns the files time and date in YYYYMMDDhhmmss format.</p>

<p align="left">To <i>set</i> the modification time of a file on the server, the 
following command is used:-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>MDTM &lt;sp&gt; YYYYMMDDhhmmss &lt;sp&gt; 
filename<br>
<br>
</b>The problem with using MDTM to set the time of a file is the command is 
ambiguous.</p>

<p align="left">For example. The command <b>MDTM 20050414173042 log.txt</b> could mean <b><i>either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) GET the time and date of a file called "20050414173042 log.txt"<br>
OR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Try to SET the time and date of a 
file called log.txt to 14th April 2005, 17:30.42<br>
<br>
<b>Announcing the MDTM command<br>
</b>The presence of the MDTM command to <i>read</i> the time and date of a file 
on the server is announced in the <b>FEAT</b> command.<br>
FTP servers which allow MDTM to <i>set</i> the time and date of a file on the 
server are unable to announce this and FTP clients must simply try the command 
to see what the response is.</p>

<hr>
<p align="left"><b>SRFT. A New FTP command to Set Remote File Time</b></p>
<p align="left">This proposed FTP command is a direct replacement for the 
overloaded use of <b>MDTM.<br>
</b>The command has the following structure</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>SRFT &lt;sp&gt;&nbsp;datetime 
&lt;sp&gt; filename<br>
<br>
</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filename is the name of the file to modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; datetime is the file's modification time and in the format YYYYMMDDhhmmss[.mmmm]. 
The full definition for this is given below.</p>
<p align="left">FTP clients which use MDTM to change the data and time of a file 
can simply issue the <b>SRFT</b> command instead. The syntax is identical to the 
overloaded <b>MDTM</b> command making the change very simple to implement.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Announcing the SRFT command</b></p>

<p align="left">The <b>SRFT</b> command will be announced in the response to the
<b>FEAT</b> command so that FTP clients can automatically detect that a server 
supports this command</p>

<hr>
<p align="left"><b>MODA. A New FTP command to Modify the Attributes of a Remote 
File</b></p>
<p align="left">This proposed FTP command is based on the same concepts as the 
proposed <b>MLST</b> command and allows a wide range of file attributes to be 
set by a client.</p>
<p align="left">FTP servers will respond to the <b>FEAT</b> command with a 
string containing a list of attributes that the server can set.<br>
For example the following response indicates a server can have the modification 
date/time, creation date/time and file accessed data/time attributes updated.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>MODA modify*;created*;accessed*;</b></p>
<p align="left">In this example, the response indicates a server can only have 
the modification date/time and accessed date/time set. This would be the case 
with a Unix based FTP server which does not have a notion of file creation 
dates.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>MODA modify*;accessed*;</b></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">FTP clients can then issue <b>MODA</b> commands with the correct 
parameters to set specific attributes on the server.<br>
The syntax is</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>MODA &lt;sp&gt; [list of attributes to set of 
the form attribute name = attribute value, separated by semi-colons] &lt;sp&gt; 
filename</b></p>
<p align="left">The <b>modify, created and accessed</b> attributes will take a 
date/time of the format YYYYMMDDhhmmss[.mmmm]. The full definition for this is 
given below.</p>
<p align="left">Examples</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following command will set the 
modification date of a file<b><br>
</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>MODA modify=20050414132045; 
thefile.txt </b></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following command will set the 
modification date and created date of a file<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>MODA 
modify=20050414132045;created=20041225081530 thefile.txt </b></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The FTP client must only issue a <b>MODA</b> command which the 
FTP server has already announced via the <b>FEAT</b> command. If a Windows FTP 
client issues a <b>MODA</b> command with a <b>created</b> attribute to a Unix 
server which has not included <b>created*;</b> in its response to <b>FEAT</b>, 
the server should reject the command.</p>
<p align="left">Note that Microsoft Windows systems support the file creation 
dates but Unix systems do not support this.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Other attributes<br>
</b>The <b>MODA</b> command allows for other attributes to be defined, either 
formally or as <i>local extensions</i> as defined in the MLST definition.<br>
Additional attributes could in include file read/write premissions, owner 
settings and group settings. This would allow a single command to implement SITE 
CHOWN, SITE CHGRP and SITE CHMOD commands.</p>
<p align="left">However the primary aim of this command (at this time) to to 
allow the modification date/time of uploaded files to be set.</p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><b>Date and Time Parameter Format</b></p>
<p align="left">The date/time is in the format</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YYYYMMDDhhmmss[.mmmm]</p>
<p align="left">The time and date will be converted to UTC. Clients and Servers can then adjust the time for their local 
Time Zone accordingly.<br>
YYYY = year (0000 to 9999), MM = month (01 to 12), DD = day (01 to 31),<br>
hh = hours (00 to 23), mm = minutes (00 to 59) and ss = seconds (00 to 59).<br>
The Year, Month, Day, Hours, Minutes and Seconds fields must all be included.</p>
<p align="left">[.mmmm] is an optional sequence of digits to support 
milliseconds.<br>
It is an arbitrary length and not limited to 4 significant digits.</p>
<p align="left">Servers should accept times both with and without milliseconds. 
If their file system does not support milliseconds, this part of the datetime 
can be ignored.<br>
Clients can send a time with or without milliseconds, depending on their file 
system and implementation.</p>
<p align="left">It is anticipated that most implementations will not make use of 
the milliseconds part of the time/date.</p>

<p><b>Consultation Period</b></p>
<p>The author of this report, Roger Hardiman, would like to hear from interested 
parties regarding the two proposed commands to see which will benefit the FTP 
community. Conversations with the authors of lftp, wzdFTPd, ProFTPd, Filezilla 
and CoreFTP have already begun and initial feedback is that a new documented 
command to set the modification time of files would be accepted and implemented.</p>
